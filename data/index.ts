I am constantly exploring new technologies and concepts that go beyond my current university curriculum. For example, I have been diving into machine learning and AI using Python, cybersecurity, and various frameworks. As a second-year university student, I haven't had the opportunity to study these advanced topics formally in my program yet. However, I take the initiative to learn them independently through online resources, including free courses on YouTube and other platforms. Before joining ÉTS, I studied natural sciences and had no prior experience in computer science. However, I fell in love with programming and technology during my very first semester at university. Outside of coding and learning, I dedicate my time to training in MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. These activities play a significant role in helping me maintain balance and stability in my life.",
